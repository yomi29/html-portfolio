<h3>Soul Land</h3>
<p>Soul Land originally titled Douluo Dalu in Chinese is a fantasy-transmigration donghua. It is among those that can be considered as an isekai by fans of Japanese animation due to 2 key elements that happened to the main protagonist Tang San. He died but he was reincarnated and transported into another fantasy world, thus he began his new life there and thatâ€™s where we follow his adventure into godhood in that realm on which the story of Soul Land revolved. It's absolutely my all-time favourites when it comes to animes</p>
<h3>Dynasty</h3>
<p>Dynasty is an American drama television series reboot based on the 1980s prime time soap opera of the same name. The first season stars glamorous businesswoman Fallon Carrington, her billionaire father Blake Carrington, her brother Steven, and Blake's new wife Cristal, their chauffeur Michael Culhane, tech billionaire Jeff Colby, Cristal's nephew Sam "Sammy Jo" Jones, and Joseph Anders, the cunning majordomo.</p>
